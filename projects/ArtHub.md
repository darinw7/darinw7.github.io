## Overview
ArtHub is a web application developed as part of a software development project my group chose to work on. It provides freelance and student artists a platform to showcase their work, collaborate with other creators, and sell their artworks through a marketplace. While social media at first glance sounds like a great idea and can offer some visibility, it doesn't allow for the type of focus and support that emerging artists need to be successful. With ArtHub, that problem is solved by offering a community-based experience solely for artists at the University of MƒÅnoa.
