summary: "A web application that I created with my group in my ICS 314 Software Engineering class."

## Overview
ArtHub is a web application developed as part of a software development project my group chose to work on. It provides freelance and student artists a platform to showcase their work, collaborate with other creators, and sell their artworks through a marketplace. While social media at first glance sounds like a great idea and can offer some visibility, it doesn't allow for the type of focus and support that emerging artists need to be successful. With ArtHub, that problem is solved by instead offering a community-based experience solely for artists at the University of Mānoa. Some of the key features included are user profiles, artwork galleries, friends/followers page, upcoming event listings, and the ability to privately upload and view your own artworks. Also, another one that stands out is being able to view a featured artist for that week, and keep up to date with what's happening within the community.

## My Contributions
As a team member on the ArtHub project, I contributed to the app by creating the Explore Artist Profiles page, collaborating with my teammates to solve problems with the signup/signout functionality, making sure that all of the pages got integrated properly and were communicating with the database. Also, I was able to receive user feedback from students on campus outside of ICS 314, and as a result gain insight into the features that stood out to them, and also the areas that still needed to be improved upon.

Below is a screenshot of what the Explore Artist Profiles Page looks like:

## Lessons Learned
Working on the development of ArtHub taught me a lot of important lessons that I can use on future projects and for software engineering in general. It provided me a really good review on topics that were covered within the class, and even went more into depth with the implementation and understanding how it all works. For example, concepts like React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, and especially databases were ones that I felt shaky on and needed more practice with. As a result, I not only got more practice but also a feel for how to use them in a much more large and complex application as opposed to the homework assignments.
