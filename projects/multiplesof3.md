This was one of my first projects that I created in my ICS 212 class, and it was a pretty simple one. The code for it was short and did not take much time for me to create. Nonetheless, it was a good experience for me as I was just learning the basics of using commands on UNIX and especially a new language at the time in C. This project however was split up into a few short functions in which started by asking the user to input a number, that would be checked for being a multiple of 3 or not, and printing a table showing all of that information.

Output of my application:
