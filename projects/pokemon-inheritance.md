This Pokemon Inheritance This was by far one of the most enjoyable assignments that I had completed in my ICS 212 class. As a fan of Pokemon, being able to include some form on it onto my code for a ICS class is something I've never experienced for. Nonetheless, the task dealt with creating child and parent classes, with the end goal to understand how interitance works. The first step that I took was to choose 3 pokemon that I wanted to use, and for each one of them create a child class file in which I would then implement a constructor, destructor and a printData function. Notice how all three of them look identical to each other, and therefore can be adjusted just a little to account for new pokemon that is added. For the parent class Pokemon, the goal is to print out Pokemon Constructor and Pokemon Destructor appropriately every time that a pokemon object is created or deleted. Last but not least, the main file which implements the main function is the part of the program that actually creates instances of each Pokemon object, as well as giving them nicknames and deleting the instances which frees up the memory at the end.

The role I had in this project was designing and implementing the entirety of the application so that it would function properly and as expected. I created all of the files myself using the UH UNIX server, from the parent and child classes to the Makefile, and .txt files in which I made to show proof of compliation of the program as well as the output that it will give every time I run this exact set of code.

This experience taught me a lot of valuable skills that I can apply towards my future coding projects. Not only did it help me understand more clearly how inheritance works, but it presented a new way of thinking for how to code more efficiently when given the right situation to succeed in. All in all, the lesson that I'm taking away from all of this is that managing my resources properly will prove to be very crucial in the amount of success that I will have, especially when I begin to code much more lengthy and challenging programs.


Below is an example of what an output may look like for this application:
