This was by far one of the most enjoyable assignments that I had in my ICS 212 class. As a fan of Pokemon, being able to include some form on it onto my code for a ICS class is something I've never experienced for. Nonetheless, the task dealt with creating child and parent classes, with the end goal to understand how interitance works. The first step that I took was to choose 3 pokemon that I wanted to use, and for each one of them create a child class file in which I would then implement a constructor, destructor and a printData function. Notice how all three of them look identical to each other, and therefore can be adjusted just a little to account for new pokemon that is added. For the parent class Pokemon, the goal is to print out Pokemon Constructor and Pokemon Destructor appropriately every time that a pokemon object is created or deleted. Last but not least, the main file which implements the main function is the part of the program that actually creates instances of each Pokemon object, as well as giving them nicknames and deleting the instances which frees up the memory at the end.

Output that I got for this application:
