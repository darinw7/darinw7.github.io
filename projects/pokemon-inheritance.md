This was by far one of the most enjoyable assignments that I had in my ICS 212 class. As a fan of Pokemon, being able to include some form on it onto my code for a ICS class is something I've never experienced for. Nonetheless, the task dealt with creating child and parent classes, with the end goal to understand how interitance works. All of the pokemon that I created had a pokemon constructor and destructor which displayed when the objects were created and deleted. They also had nicknames which were individually accessed by their own key, and therefore information about their type and weight were displayed as well.

Output that I got for this application:
