This is a Bank Database program that I created for ICS 212 last semester. It allows users to do varius things like add a new account, find or delete one, and print out all relevant information that is related for a specific account. This project was split up into two major parts, the user interface and the database. The user interface received input from the user and took care of all the interactions for this entire program. Meanwhile, the database was set up to implement the functions that would actually simulate what a bank is like.

As a whole, this project took a lot of work and effort to implement. I spent countless hours writing code to simulate the real and proper experience and ensure that everything was working properly. Throughout the process, I had to trace lines of code individually whenever I was not receiving the proper output that I was expecting and began to get a little frustrated at myself. Nonetheless, it taught me a lot not only about programming in C/C++ but that programming requires having skills like thinking outside of the box and things will not just be given to me for free. In the end, being able to complete this project in both languages was a nice learning experience, and I hope that there will be more opportunities like this sometime in the near future!

Here is some output that demonstrations how the application interacts with the user:
