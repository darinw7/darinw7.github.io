## I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in just a short period of time has transformed the entire field of education, for both better and worse reasons. In particular, it has evolved into being a useful tool within Software Engineering, a topic that requires good problem solving skills in order to be successful. That is because both students and educators can benefit from a enhanced way of learning that can make concepts easier to understand. On the other hand, using these technologies becomes a problem when solely relying on it to do all the work, which is why many teachers in general prohibit any use of these tools and will consider it as cheating if used. Nontheless, there are endless good possiblities that can come with AI, but only when used in the right situations.
