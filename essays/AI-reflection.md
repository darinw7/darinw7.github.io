## I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in just a short period of time has transformed the entire field of education, for both better and worse reasons. In particular, it has evolved into being a useful tool within Software Engineering, a topic that requires good problem solving skills in order to be successful. That is because both students and educators can benefit from a enhanced way of learning that can make concepts easier to understand. On the other hand, using these technologies becomes a problem when solely relying on it to do all the work, which is why many teachers in general prohibit any use of these tools and will consider it as cheating if used. Nontheless, there are endless good possiblities that can come with AI, but only when used in the right situations.

## II. Personal Experience with AI
1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
     - Throughout the semester, as the homework assignments continued to get more difficult and jam packed with material, I began using AI partially whenever I would get stuck to ensure that I would finish it in time. The procedure I took was watch the video from the professor once and take notes on a piece of paper before actually attempting it. It was successful up to a certain extent, but I would always find that there were things I missed or didn't fully understand which is why starting at E18 (Functional Programming), I began using it on a regular basis on parts that I had no clue to solve. For example, I would often ask ChatGPT how to implement a certain function given the instructions, and it ended up giving me mixed results. Sometimes, it would give me a perfect response, while other times it would go completely off topic, which is the level of randomness I belive ChatGPT represents.
  
2. In-class Practice WODs
     - I did not use AI for the in-class practice WODs because while it might have gave me a solution to the problem quicker, this category had no effect whatsoever on my course grade so I used this opportunity instead to learn the material better, and prepare for the real WOD's instead, which I believe did pay off in the long term.

3. In-class WODs
     - I did end up using AI for this section because while I did try to do them on my own, as the time began running out, I began to panic and couldn't think very clearly so I thought I might as well see what ChatGPT would say and go from there. While there were certainly moments that it took me a lot of time just asking it questions, I believe that it was successful because it at least got my brain thinking as opposed to sitting still not knowing what to do.
       
4. Essays
     - For the reflection essays in this course, I stayed away from using any type of AI outside of checking spelling and grammar. That is because it would certainly not capture my voice since at that point, it wouldn't even be considered my own writing if I'm just using text that it generates. Also, I believe that compared to coding, writing does not require use of artificial intelligence in any way to do quality work, but that was just my perspective the entire semester.

5. Final project
     - As for the final project that I am currently working with my group on, I have used AI to guide me along the way due to the complexity and new things that I haven't been introduced to prior. For example, outside of the Digits module in which was only covered for a short while, I did not know how to use databases, or tools like Vercel and Supabase. Therefore, I was able to use ChatGPT for this and get a better understanding of how to get everything up and running.
   
6. Learning a concept / tutorial
     - I have used AI to understand more in depth about how many concepts work, such as Function Programming, UI Design, Databases, Application Design, and many others whenever I got confused. In my opinion, it was worth the effort because it helped guide me the right way especially since the course is very fast-paced and doesn't allow for much time to be spent on any one topic in particular.
   
7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
     - I have not used AI to answer a question within class or Discord because often times those questions are the same ones that I have of which I also don't have the answer to. Also, in terms of using technology to do so, I tend to avoid it unless I know for sure how something works or the exact answer with strong certainty to prevent accidentally giving misinformation to others.
   
8. Asking or answering a smart-question
     - I have used ChatGPT to answer a smart-question because it allows me to receive a more detailed response, and avoids getting answers in return that are not very helpful.
    
13. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
     - I have used AI to give me a coding example in the past, especially when I was stuck. For example, I asked it "give me an example of how to create a card component using React Bootstrap that shows a user's profile image, name, bio, and contact information". As a result, it was able to show me how to create one and even showed me how to create different designs based off of that.
    
15. Explaining code
     - Being able to understand what code does and means is one of the hardest parts I've found that comes with being a programmer. Personally, I find that being able to write code and explain it are two completely different things and aren't related to it each other. I have used AI many times to try and understand code that I've created and others that are given in templates for example. While this is certainly one of the toughest jobs within the business, I feel that having this skill is also one of the most important in order to be a successful software engineer.
    
17. Writing code
     - Starting from stratch when creating code is certainly not very fun, and can become overwhelming at times. I have used AI at many times throughout the semester to not write the entire code for me, but rather give me a starting point where I feel that it is possible to work off and reach my end goal. For example, I ask it for suggestions on how to create a function but not for all the lines to where I could just copy and paste it into my code.
    
19. Documenting code
     - I have not used AI to document code because outside of what it gives to me which occasionally does include comments, I like to put my own documentation so that I know what exactly each line is doing and as a result avoid confusion trying to understand what role everything has.
    
21. Quality assurance e.g. “What’s wrong with this code <code here>” or “Fix the ESLint errors in <code here>”
     - In my perspective, I have a lot of experience asking ChatGPT how to fix code I have, especially after spending hours just staring at it. After seeing what it has to say, sometimes I end up asking myself "How did I not see that" as if it was just a silly mistake. I believe that sometimes it is just necessary to have another eye looking at it or in this case technology to get a quicker fix and avoid going back and forth trying to solve a problem that one just might not see without the help of another.
    
23. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
     - Outside of all the topics I've mentioned up to this point, I would also say that I used AI to summarize some of the long readings required for the course such as for deploying an app to Vercel, and understanding the steps for how to downwload PostgreSQL given that the instructions were quite unclear and tough to understand.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Incorporating AI into my code for ICS 314 has been a very up and down learning experience but one that I have really enjoyed. Tools like ChatGPT and Github Copilot at times helped me to understand more clearly how certain concepts work, such as proper techniques for functional programming and solving loads of ESLint errors that were left hopelessly on my screen. For example, when I had no clue how to solve a certain problem that would have certainly taken up multiple hours out of my time, using ChatGPT not only fixed the issue but also gave a quality explanation as to why it produced the response it did. At the same time however, the responses it gives are not always 100% correct, and may not do exactly what I want it to, so I've learned with this to use it as a tool that guides me to my end goal, rather than something that just gives me all the answers. All in all, this process has enhanced my understanding of software engineering concepts by forcing me to think critically about what I've learned and put it all together.

## IV. Practical Applications
Outside of the classroom, AI has also taken over real-world projects, which has enhanced the efficiency of many major industries. For example, companies like Microsoft and Google report that 20-30% of their code is written by AI, which suggests that its role within coding is only continuing to get larger. As far as the effectiveness goes, an example would be with GitHub Copilot and how it is able to save on average 55% of people's time working on tasks that would otherwise be spent without it.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
While using AI in ICS 314 certainly helped out in many ways, there were also challenges that I faced along the way. One of the problems I had was dealing with the reliability of the information that ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot gave me, and the frustrations that came afterwards when the code would not run at all. Also, another challenge that I found was how much I had to rely on AI especially on the WODs to the point that a lot of times I would be copy and pasting code that it was recommending without even trying to understand what it was doing. As a result, I find that it is very important to actually find the sweet spot in between both sides. In terms of future opportunities, I believe that it has the potential to do things like suggest improvements given code a person already has, and just continuing to improve their accuracy within responses to the user's benefit.

## VI. Comparative Analysis
When comparing traditional teaching methods to AI-enhanced approaches within software engineering education, there are some clear unique advantages for both. In an ideal scenario, they would get combined to create the best possible learning experience for everyone. Let's now consider a comparison between the two for three different categories. In terms of engagement, I would give the edge to AI because it's always available to answer questions as opposed to having to wait for a teacher or TA. For knowledge retention, traditional methods are still better in my opinion due to it not just giving answers away for free, and a result allows for better understanding for why things work the way they are. Last but not least, practical skill development is an AI based thing because of how it introduces people to real world design patterns, and leads to cleaner code much more efficiently than humans are capable of doing.

## VII. Future Considerations
Looking into the future, I believe that the role of AI in software engineering education will continue to increase, and as a result transform the way students are able to learn, practice, and apply the skills needed for bigger and tougher projects. As far as potential advancements go, I could see the creation of more specific AI models that can go more in depth to user's questions as opposed to keeping everything generic and in a way boring to read. Inevitability as it surges, more problems will arise and solutions will need to be found in order to combat them. One of the many challenges that there will be is the overuse on homework assignments, in which will cause many to believe that they have the skills required when ultimately only those of artificial intelligence are on display.

## VIII. Conclusion
As I reflect on my experience in ICS 314, AI has certainly become a significant part of the software engineering process today seeing how its use is allowed within the course. ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are just two of many more tools that have become a key part of programming recently in our daily lives. Despite this, it does still require good critical thinking skills, and a little knowledge of the material in order to put them to proper use. In my opinion, outside of certain classes where it would be unnecessary to integrate, it's not about avoiding the use of artificial intelligence entirely, but using it in an appropriate manner that allows for growth and learning to continue taking place.
