## I. Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) in just a short period of time has transformed the entire field of education, for both better and worse reasons. In particular, it has evolved into being a useful tool within Software Engineering, a topic that requires good problem solving skills in order to be successful. That is because both students and educators can benefit from a enhanced way of learning that can make concepts easier to understand. On the other hand, using these technologies becomes a problem when solely relying on it to do all the work, which is why many teachers in general prohibit any use of these tools and will consider it as cheating if used. Nontheless, there are endless good possiblities that can come with AI, but only when used in the right situations.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding
Incorporating AI into my code for ICS 314 has been a very up and down learning experience but one that I have really enjoyed. Tools like ChatGPT and Github Copilot at times helped me to understand more clearly how certain concepts work, such as proper techniques for functional programming and solving loads of ESLint errors that were left hopelessly on my screen. For example, when I had no clue how to solve a certain problem that would have certainly taken up multiple hours out of my time, using ChatGPT not only fixed the issue but also gave a quality explanation as to why it produced the response it did. At the same time however, the responses it gives are not always 100% correct, and may not do exactly what I want it to, so I've learned with this to use it as a tool that guides me to my end goal, rather than something that just gives me all the answers. All in all, this process has enhanced my understanding of software engineering concepts by forcing me to think critically about what I've learned and put it all together.

## IV. Practical Applications
Outside of the classroom, AI has also taken over real-world projects, which has enhanced the efficiency of many major industries. For example, companies like Microsoft and Google report that 20-30% of their code is written by AI, which suggests that its role within coding is only continuing to get larger. As far as the effectiveness goes, an example would be with GitHub Copilot and how it is able to save on average 55% of people's time working on tasks that would otherwise be spent without it.

## V. Challenges and Opportunities
While using AI in ICS 314 certainly helped out in many ways, there were also challenges that I faced along the way. One of the problems I had was dealing with the reliability of the information that ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot gave me, and the frustrations that came afterwards when the code would not run at all. Also, another challenge that I found was how much I had to rely on AI especially on the WODs to the point that a lot of times I would be copy and pasting code that it was recommending without even trying to understand what it was doing. As a result, I find that it is very important to actually find the sweet spot in between both sides. In terms of future opportunities, I believe that it has the potential to do things like suggest improvements given code a person already has, and just continuing to improve their accuracy within responses to the user's benefit.
