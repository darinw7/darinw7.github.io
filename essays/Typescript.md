## Introduction: Thoughts on Typescript
Recently in my ICS 314 - software enginnering class, we have began to code in the Typescript language. Just two weeks ago, I only had experience in programming for Java and C/C++. While I know that this experience will be a significant challenge, I'm excited to learn more about Typescript and work towards being a professional programmer. In my limited experience so far, I've noticed many similarities that it has with Java outside of having to get used to new syntax and other minor things that is to be expected when working with a new language. 

## Good/Bad
In my opinion, Typescript is a good programming language given that it has benefits such as static typing which allows types to be defined for variables, arguments, and return values. There are also many cool futures within, but I would also argue that a negative is for people that don't have experience with Typescript and are coming from a language like Javascript. This would lead to a pretty significant learning curve due to new concepts like types which are absolutely essential but can be challenging to understand without previous knowledge from like Java which has them.

## WOD's are difficult, but can be rewarding
In the class, we also have exercises that are known as WODs(Workouts of the Day). Based on the practice ones we are given, I do find them to be helpful in learning the material that we are taught in class. At first, when I heard about these from former students of the course and that they are timed, I was a little stressed out knowing that I have so little room for error in order to get a passing grade for them. However after experiencing it for real, I now realize that the purpose is just to make sure that we are keeping up with the material on a consistent basis, and putting a lot of time and effort into repetitions is the recipe to succeeding on them. I also enjoy how there are group WODs where we work with a partner, and therefore have to communicate to make sure that we both are on the same page, and also tests our understanding of the material by having us explain it to others.

## Conclusion
All in all, Typescript is like all other languages in that it takes a lot of effort to learn and especially to master. There are also positives and negatives in comparison to other, and over time I hope to discover what works better for each so that I can use it to the best of my potential. Nonetheless, I am very excited to learn more about Typescript and everything it has to offer, and cant wait to see how this experience goes as I get more repititions, practice, and time spent on this new and sure to be fun experience.
