## Introduction
In my ICS 314 Software Engineering class, web development is certainly one of the main focuses but there is much more to it than just that. It also involves many other skills that revolve around planning, designing, testing, and actual development of a software system. While the tools used were specific to the learning process, the concepts taught - such as user interface frameworks, and design patterns - can be put to use in many other cases too. Within this essay, I will use the opportunity to reflect on those two areas within the course that have especially stood out to me, and why it has played such an important role in helping me gain a better understanding of software engineering in its entirety.

## User Interface Frameworks (e.g. React & Bootstrap)
User Interface Frameworks consist of tools and libraries that can be used to create elements in which allows users to interact with the application process. They include components used to create various useful things such as buttons, menus, forms, and other means that utilize interactions with a user. From my experience with UI Frameworks, I've learned not only how to use them to create websites that look good visually, but more importantly how they allow for more consistency and reliability which are such important factors when it comes to creating software that can be appreciated by others. I also found it to be extremely useful for group work as it ensures that the structure and design standards are met, and all group members are able to work together effectively. Also, outside the world of web development, desktop and mobile applications are just a few examples that benefit from this usage. Last but not least, UI frameworks are very good in the sense that it promotes thought when designing the user interface, an aspect that can make or break any given piece of software that is out in the real world today.
