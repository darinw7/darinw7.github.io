## Introduction
In my ICS 314 Software Engineering class, web development is certainly one of the main focuses but there is much more to it than just that. It also involves many other skills that revolve around planning, designing, testing, and actual development of a software system. While the tools used were specific to the learning process, the concepts taught - such as user interface frameworks, and design patterns - can be put to use in many other cases too. Within this essay, I will use the opportunity to reflect on those two areas within the course that have especially stood out to me, and why it has played such an important role in helping me gain a better understanding of software engineering as a whole.

## User Interface Frameworks


## Design Patterns


## Conclusion
