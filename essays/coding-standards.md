Software engineering is quite a challenging topic to learn especially when things are challenging and unclear, which is why asking smart questions can be the difference between success and failure. The concept of being able to communicate effectively with others is a necessary skill to have in the field, and actually benefits everyone who is involed. Whether it is about asking questions or even answering them, a similar rule holds.

All in all, asking smart questions seems to be of lesser significance, but is actually just as important as creating good code.
