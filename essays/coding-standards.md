## Introduction - Early Impressions
After being introduced to ESLint within VSCode for a week now, I have to say that there are many positives and negatives that come along with it. When I tried it out for the first time, I was quite overwhelmed by the amount of errors that it was telling me needed to be fixed. All of the small syntax problems, from missing semicolons to invalid spacing, filled my entire screen up with red squiggly lines and left me frustrated thinking about how boring and dull it is having to follow a specific style of coding that is not interchangable. However, as the week went on and I completed assignments for my ICS 314 Software Engineering class that required creating code that was ESLint error free, it has become clear to me that this is for the better in the long term despite it being painful now.

## Advantages & Disadvantages
One of the advantages of having coding standards is that it helps create cleaner code and reduces the possibility that significant problems go unchecked. However, the benefits go beyond creating error-free code. It is about making it so that it remains consistent through all parts of the source code so that it becomes readable to others who come into contact with it. Despit
