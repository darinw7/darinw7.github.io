## Introduction - Early Impressions
After being introduced to ESLint within VSCode for a week now, I have to say that there are many positives and negatives that come along with it. When I tried it out for the first time, I was quite overwhelmed by the amount of errors that it was telling me needed to be fixed. All of the small syntax problems, from missing semicolons to invalid spacing, filled my entire screen up with red squiggly lines and left me frustrated thinking about

## Answering Smart Questions Is Just as Important as Asking Them
While a large part of my essay is centered around asking Smart questions, it is also true the other way around. When providing answers to other people's questions, it is essential to explain the process clearly, and let them know if something doesn't look or sound right so that they can go and look it over again for possible errors. Also by completing this part successfully, the entire StackOverflow community can reap the benefits by learning from each other all at the same time.


## Conclusion

Software engineering is quite a challenging topic to learn especially when things are challenging and unclear, which is why asking smart questions can be the difference between success and failure. The concept of being able to communicate effectively with others is a necessary skill to have in the field, and actually benefits everyone who is involed. Whether it is about asking questions or even answering them, a similar rule holds. It is about doing the best that we can to better everyone's experiences and gain knowledge together as a large group. All in all, asking smart questions seems to be of lesser significance, but is actually just as important as creating good code.
