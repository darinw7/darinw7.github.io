## Introduction

The concept of design patterns can be both challenging and rewarding at the same time. In the world of software engineering, even the most talented and skillful programmers often do not create all of their code from scratch. That's not to say that they aren't capable of doing so but rather there are better methods they can use to reach their end goals more efficiently. In this essay, I will go over what exactly design patterns are, and how they are relevant to my coding experience so far.
