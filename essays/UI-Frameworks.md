## Introduction
After being introduced to ESLint within VSCode for a week now, I have to say that there are many positives and negatives that come along with it. When I tried it out for the first time, I was quite overwhelmed by the amount of errors that it was telling me needed to be fixed. All of the small syntax problems, from missing semicolons to invalid spacing, filled my entire screen up with red squiggly lines and left me frustrated thinking about how boring and dull it is having to follow a specific style of coding that is not interchangeable. However, as the week went on and I completed assignments for my ICS 314 Software Engineering class that required creating code that was ESLint error free, it has become clear to me that this is for the better in the long term despite it being painful now.

## Advantages & Disadvantages of using Bootstrap 5 for Software Engineering
One of the advantages of having coding standards is that it helps create cleaner code and reduces the possibility of significant problems go unchecked. However, the benefits go beyond creating error-free code. It is about making it as consistent as possible throughout all parts of the source code so that it becomes readable to others who come into contact with it. This is also really good practice for group projects so that the same rules are followed by all members and they can be better equipped to collaborate with each other, which is a big part of software engineering.

In terms of the disadvantages, I have experience from my ICS 212 Program Structure class where there were harsh rules on what we could and could not do for all of the assignments and projects. Some examples were that header comments were required for all files and functions, only one return statement was allowed per function, and no break statements in for/while loops. I find that this can be especially challenging depending on what programming language is used, and with being restricted to following a certain set of rules all the time especially for people just starting out.


## Why not just using raw HTML and CSS?

While there are both positives and negatives that come from using a certain set of coding standards, I now find that the good outweighs the bad. While I do find this process inconvenient, especially when a long list of ESLint errors appear, keeping the standards true becomes easier to do with more practice. All in all, sticking to coding standards has shown me that consistency is very important in order to achieve readable code. Going through this entire process isn't only about following certain rules every time, but it really is meant to strengthen the habits used in coding and improve as long as hard work and effort are put in.
