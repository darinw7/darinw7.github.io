## Introduction
Recently in my ICS 314 Software Engineering class, we have been learning about user-interface(UI) frameworks and the many fascinating qualities (both good and bad) that it offers when creating web pages. In particular, Bootstrap 5 is among the most popular options and allows for things like interaction with the user though buttons, navigation bars, and many other things. In my short experience using it, I found many positive takeaways, as well as some not so good things about it especially for beginners and those trying to understand how to even use it properly for the first time.



## Advantages & Disadvantages of using Bootstrap 5 for Software Engineering

One of the advantages of using Bootstrap 5 and frameworks in general is with how a large part of the code is already ready to use, and therefore significantly reduces the amount of time needed and frustration that comes by trying to code everything from scratch. I also find that this process helps to ensure consistency across all users and projects, which as a result improves readability for everyone. While everything may seem good so far, there undoubtedly are negatives that come with using it too. For example, it limits the amount of customization can be done, and the learning curve can actually make it take even longer when trying to learn what some lines of code and when to use it as opposed to just implementing it normally.


## Why not just use raw HTML and CSS?
While it is totally possible to create webpages with just HTML and CSS, using UI Frameworks can take it to the next level by making the entire code much more organized and save valuable team that you could be using on other parts of the project. In particular, I have found the container, row, and column classes some of the most useful tools that I can use to structure my page in a way that looks right. Ultimately, the difference in the end can be seen with how much more of a time-friendly solution it is and gets the job done without having to get stressed out that some parts of code isn't working as expected, and more so having to find out which line needs to be fixed.


## Conclusion
All in all, I believe that using UI frameworks prioritizes speed and consistency as opposed to more control over design and structure when using just HTML and CSS. Therefore, both can be really good depending on the situation and there is no "one size fits all" analogy that can be said about this either way.
