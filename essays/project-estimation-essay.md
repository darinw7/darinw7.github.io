## Introduction
The effort estimates that I came up with had to do with understanding the skill level I possessed with this material, and trying to be realistic about it so that I could come back and look at how accurate it was once I finished my part of the project.

## My strategy to creating effort estimates
The effort estimates that I came up with had to do with understanding the skill level I possessed with this material, and trying to be realistic about it so that I could come back and look at how accurate it was once I finished my part of the project. To do this, I had to look back into the past experiences earlier in the semester from the assignments and in class exercises while also knowing that this was gonna be much larger and time consuming compared to anything we had completed prior.

## Benefits to Creating Estimations in Advance 
After beginning the process of getting the project up and running, I have found a few benefits that come with doing effort estimations prior to even starting the work. One benefit that I noticed right away is that it forced myself to stay on top of my work so that I wouldn't fall behind and hold up the rest of my team members who already had a lot to complete. I ended up creating a rough outline and plan for how I wanted to split up my share of the work into different times, based on how much time I expected it to take and my schedule. While the estimate indeed ended up quite different than reality, it has still taught me better time management skills that I can put to use for future improvements of the website and that I can not just slack off because these estimates are really just estimates and can not be trusted too seriously.

## Benefits to Tracking Actual Effort
Similar to estimating the time it takes to complete something, it is also very valuable to actually track the amount it takes to complete the task. Even though nothing can be changed about how much time it ends up taking to complete a task, it means a lot to be able to see how much I underestimated, or in the rare case overestimate the amount of effort required. Another benefit that I found from doing this is that it ensured all of my group members were able to pick what part of the website they wanted to create while also being able to keep the share of work somewhat equal based on the complexity of each one that was assigned.

## My strategy to tracking actual effort 
As for Milestone 1 of the final project, the method I used to track my actual effort came in the form of a timer which started from the time I began working on the first issue to when I completely finished the parts that I was assigned to. After trying this out, I have started to understand why this is such a popular method used and a core aspect of project building especially with groups. I found that this process does not really take much effort or time to do especially when there are a surplus amount of benefits that come from doing it.


## Final takeaways
All in all, I have learned a lot from effort estimation even if it is not 100% accurate or even anywear close to that. It adds a lot of value and benefits at the expense of very little time and effort, and also provides very important experience and talent that many companies and people in the world look for. Given that I now have a little experience myself with estimating efforts, my plan going forward will be to continue improving the techniques I've learned, and find more ways to put them to use not only in this case but also with anything that I do.
