Overall, the testing went well with the test cases all being successful and without any errors that made the program function incorrectly. All of the user interface functions worked properly in setting up the menu to be used along with the database. The database functions(add,printall,find,delete,write,and read) successfully tested cases where certin edges might not be caught such as adding a duplicate
record or searching for a record with an account number that doesn't exist. The readfile and writefile functions to the specific text file "records.txt" were properly implemented at the right time, with
readfile being called at the beginning and writefile after the user chooses to quit the program. They properly read from the file into the linked and vice versa with writing from the list into the file. 
In regards to debug mode, it includes output which is the printed to the screen detailing the function that was called, including the names and values, to test the program more throughly and visuaize
better what is happening. So in general, there are no significant issues thatcame up while doing testing for the program as the results were expected and the parts of the user interface and database were implemented properly.
